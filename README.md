# Project Overview-

This project provides an in-depth visualization of the K-Means clustering algorithm and Lloyd's iterative method for clustering data points. Through a basic notebook, animated visualizations, and a GUI interface, users can explore the clustering process, parameter control, and convergence.

# Key Features-

- **K-Means Visualization**: Visualizes the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **Lloydâ€™s Algorithm Animation**: Illustrates the step-by-step process of reaching a local minimum.
- **Interactive GUI**: Adjust the number of clusters in real time with a slider and restart with a refresh button for new random initializations.

# Uses and Significance-

Clustering is foundational in data science and machine learning. This project demonstrates the effectiveness and iterative nature of K-Means clustering, helping users visualize and understand the algorithmâ€™s behavior and convergence toward local minima.

# How the Project Works-

This project is divided into three main components:

**Basic K-Means Visualization**: The introductory notebook provides an overview of K-Means and Lloydâ€™s Algorithm.

**Lloydâ€™s Algorithm Animation**: Visualizes every iteration of the clustering process for a given number of clusters, saving the animation as a GIF.

**Interactive GUI**: A GUI built with Tkinter allows users to adjust the number of clusters and restart the process with a random initialization, showcasing Lloyd's Algorithm's iterative convergence.

# Installation-

**Prerequisites-**

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tkinter
```

**Required Libraries-**

- *NumPy*: For efficient numerical computations.
- *Matplotlib*: For plotting and animating cluster progress.
- *Tkinter*: For creating the interactive GUI.

# Directory Structure-

Ensure your project directory is organized as follows:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ basic.ipynb                (Provides an overview of K-Means and Lloyd's algorithm)
â”œâ”€â”€ Llyod's_Algo.ipynb         (Generates animations for the iterative process)
â”œâ”€â”€ animation_gui.py           (GUI to adjust cluster parameters and reset clustering)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

# Basic K-Means Clustering-

**To understand the fundamentals:**

Open `basic.ipynb`: This notebook introduces K-Means clustering and Lloydâ€™s Algorithm, laying the groundwork for understanding clustering and iterative optimization.

# Lloydâ€™s Algorithm with Animation-

**To visualize the clustering process:**

Open `Llyod's_Algo.ipynb`.

Animation: This notebook animates each iteration of Lloydâ€™s Algorithm, updating cluster centers and labels until convergence. The animation is saved as a GIF for later review.

# Interactive GUI-

**To interact with clustering in real-time:**

Run `animation_gui.py`.

GUI Controls: Adjust the number of clusters with a slider, and use the refresh button to reset the clustering process with new initial positions. This showcases how different starting points can lead to various local minima, demonstrating Lloyd's Algorithmâ€™s convergence behavior.

# Future Plans-

**Next steps for this project include:**

- **Enhanced GUI Options**: Adding more controls, like choosing distance metrics or initialization methods.
- **3D Clustering Visualization**: Extending the visualizations to 3D space for more complex datasets.
- **Real-World Dataset Integration**: Using actual datasets to better illustrate clustering applications.

# Acknowledgments-
